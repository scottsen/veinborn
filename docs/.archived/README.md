# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical or outdated documentation that has been archived to reduce confusion and maintain documentation accuracy.

## Archive Structure

### `/development-history/`
Historical records of documentation reorganizations and development milestones:
- `DOCUMENTATION_REORGANIZATION_2025-11-05.md` - Documentation restructuring record
- `REORGANIZATION_2025-11-05.md` - Project reorganization record

**Why archived:** These are historical records of past reorganization efforts. Useful for understanding project history but not needed for current development.

### `/analysis/`
Reserved for archived architectural analysis documents when consolidation occurs.

## When to Archive

Documents should be moved here when they are:
1. **Historical records** - Useful for history but not current development
2. **Superseded** - Replaced by newer, better documentation
3. **Outdated** - Information no longer reflects reality
4. **Redundant** - Content consolidated into other documents

## Active Documentation

For current, up-to-date documentation, see:
- `/docs/README.md` or `/docs/INDEX.md` - Documentation map
- `/docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Current project status (source of truth)
- `/docs/START_HERE.md` - Developer onboarding guide
