## 📋 Current Sprint: Polish & Playtest

### High Priority Tasks (Ready Now)

#### 1. Playtest & Balance (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Why:** The game is complete but untested by players

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Play the game for 30-60 minutes (end-to-end test)
- [ ] Document gameplay issues and balance problems
- [ ] Test all character classes
- [ ] Verify floor progression feels right
- [ ] Test mining/crafting loop for fun factor
- [ ] Validate equipment progression
- [ ] Check monster difficulty curve

**How to Playtest:**
```bash
cd /home/user/veinborn
python3 run_textual.py
```

**What to Look For:**
- Is combat balanced? (Too easy? Too hard?)
- Is mining fun? (Risk vs reward working?)
- Does crafting feel rewarding?
- Do character classes feel different?
- Is floor progression smooth?
- Any crashes or bugs?
- Are monster types varied enough?

#### 2. Test Suite Status ✅ RESOLVED
**Current Status:**
- 1065 passing
- 0 failing (MP async-cleanup + lock deadlock bugs fixed in commit 33d72f7)
- 2 correctly skipped (Lua timeout tests — C-level execution limitation)
- ✅ All functional tests passing

**Note:** The 2 skipped tests (`test_infinite_loop_timeout` and `test_long_computation_timeout`)
cannot pass with the current signal-based timeout mechanism because lupa's C-level Lua
execution doesn't respond to Python signals. These would require a multiprocessing-based
timeout implementation, which is not worth the complexity for edge-case timeout protection.

#### 3. Content Status ✅ EXCEEDS GOALS

**Design Goal:** 15-20 monster types
**Actual:** **19 monster types** (111% of goal!)

**Monster Types (19 total):**

*Early Game (9):*
- ✅ goblin, orc, troll, bat, skeleton, ogre, wolf, spider, imp

*Mid Game (5):*
- ✅ wyvern, golem, wraith, mimic, vampire

*Late Game (5):*
- ✅ lich, demon, basilisk, phoenix, ancient_horror

**Recipes:** 16 total (10 regular + 6 legendary)
- ✅ 6 weapons (copper → adamantite progression)
- ✅ 4 armor (copper → adamantite progression)
- ✅ 6 legendary (flaming_sword, arcane_staff, dragon_bow, phoenix_armor, shadow_cloak, titans_hammer)

**Status:** ✅ **Content is COMPLETE** - exceeds design goals!

**Possible Expansions (Optional):**
- Additional monster variants (elite versions, bosses)
- More recipe variety (accessories, ranged weapons)
- Special equipment with unique effects

---

### Medium Priority Tasks

#### 4. Tutorial System (Not Started)
**Why:** New players need guidance

**What to Build:**
- [ ] First-run tutorial messages
- [ ] Help screen (H key)
- [ ] Keybind reference UI
- [ ] Mining tutorial (first ore vein encounter)
- [ ] Crafting tutorial (first forge encounter)
- [ ] Combat tutorial (first monster encounter)

**Implementation Ideas:**
- Tutorial messages in `src/core/tutorial.py`
- Help widget in `src/ui/textual/widgets/help_widget.py`
- Tutorial state tracking in player profile

**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours

#### 5. Special Room Types (Not Started)
**Why:** Design mentions varied room types, only basic rooms exist

**Room Types to Add:**
- [ ] Treasure room (high-quality loot)
- [ ] Monster den (extra monsters, mini-boss)
- [ ] Ore chamber (multiple high-quality veins)
- [ ] Shrine (healing, temporary buffs)
- [ ] Trap room (pressure plates, spikes, arrows)

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/core/world.py` - Room generation logic
- `data/balance/game_constants.yaml` - Room spawn rates

**Estimated Time:** 8-12 hours

#### 6. Legendary Recipes (Partial)
**Why:** Design mentions legendary tier, mostly basic/advanced recipes exist

**Current Recipes:** 17 (mostly basic and advanced)

**Add Legendary Recipes:**
- [ ] Flaming Sword (fire damage bonus)
- [ ] Arcane Staff (spell power)
- [ ] Dragon Bow (piercing attack)
- [ ] Phoenix Armor (regeneration)
- [ ] Shadow Cloak (stealth bonus)

**Files to Modify:**
- `data/balance/recipes.yaml` - Add legendary recipes
- Mark as boss drops or rare dungeon finds

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

---

### Low Priority (Future)

#### 7. Advanced AI Features
**Why:** Current simple aggressive AI works well, state machine is future enhancement

**Future Enhancements:**
- Idle/Chasing/Wandering/Fleeing state machines
- Line-of-sight checks
- Monster coordination

**Estimated Time:** 12-16 hours (not urgent)
**Note:** Removed placeholder tests (2025-11-05) - will write fresh tests when implementing

#### 8. Performance Optimization
**Current Performance:** Unknown (needs profiling)

**Goals:**
- Map generation < 100ms
- Game loop 60+ FPS
- No memory leaks in long sessions

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Profile map generation
- [ ] Profile game loop
- [ ] Test long play sessions (1+ hours)
- [ ] Optimize hot paths

**Estimated Time:** 4-8 hours
