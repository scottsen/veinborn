# Character Progression System

## Core Philosophy

Growth in Brogue comes from **what you do**, not arbitrary level-ups. Skills improve through use, and combining different approaches unlocks emergent abilities.

## Memory-Based Skill Unlocks

Skills unlock through remembered lessons from your brother:

**Early Game (Depths 1-5):**
- "Remember how he showed you to hold your shield..."
- "That's the stance he taught you for tracking..."
- Basic combat, movement, and survival skills

**Mid Game (Depths 6-12):**
- "This reminds you of when he faced that pack of wolves..."
- "He taught you to adapt, just like this..."
- Advanced techniques and tactical awareness

**Late Game (Depths 13+):**
- "Now you understand what he meant..."
- "You've surpassed his teachings and found your own way..."
- Mastery abilities and unique combinations

## Skill Growth Through Use
