# Crafting & Materials System

## Core Material Properties

Understanding materials is essential for creating interesting choices across different player archetypes.

### Physical Properties
```
- Density (weight, impact, durability)
- Malleability (workability, adaptability)
- Balance (accuracy, speed)
- Grain (edge retention, sharpness)
```

### Magical Properties
```
- Resonance (spell amplification)
- Attunement (holds enchantments)
- Conductivity (channels energy)
- Stability (controls chaos)
```

### Subtle Properties
```
- Luminance (light/dark affinity)
- Silence (stealth factor)
- Precision (critical potential)
- Harmony (synergy potential)
```

## Class Preferences

Different classes care about different material properties:

### Warrior
- High Density + Balance = Reliable damage
- Grain + Precision = Better crits
- Wants physical perfection

### Mage
- High Resonance + Stability = Spell power
- Conductivity + Attunement = Complex enchants
- Ignores most physical props

### Rogue
- Silence + Balance = Stealth attacks
- Precision + Grain = Critical strikes
- Values subtle properties

### Spellblade
- Balance + Resonance = Spell strikes
- Harmony + Conductivity = Unique combos
- Needs good physical AND magical

### Ranger
- Balance + Precision = Accuracy
- Luminance + Silence = Environment bonus
- Focuses on adaptability

## Material Personalities

Each material has a distinct "personality" that shapes how weapons grow. Rather than random stat rolls, materials determine the *flavor* and *growth path* of items.

### Iron
**"The Reliable Companion"**
- Steady, predictable growth
- High stability - holds enchantments well
- Good all-around choice
- Brother probably used this
- *Theme:* Dependable, traditional, foundational

### Silver
**"The Moon's Shadow"**
- Quick adaptation to combat styles
- Volatile growth - unpredictable but exciting
- Strong resonance with magic
- Moon-touched properties
- *Theme:* Mercurial, magical, adaptive

### Shadowvine (Organic)
**"The Whisperer"**
- Natural stealth properties
- Grows stronger in darkness
- Adaptive to rogue tactics
- Dark essence conductor
- *Theme:* Silent, shadowy, cunning

### Elderwood (Organic)
**"The Ancient's Gift"**
- Life resonance
- Gradual, deep growth
- Strong enchantment capacity
- Natural essence affinity
- *Theme:* Patient, wise, enduring

### Mithril (Rare)
**"The Perfect Balance"**
- Balanced physical and magical
- Rapid growth potential
- Multiple affinity paths
- Harmony with all playstyles
- *Theme:* Versatile, powerful, rare

### Dragonglass (Crystal)
**"The Chaos Shard"**
- Chaotic, dangerous growth
- High risk, high reward
- Unstable but powerful
- Can develop unique properties
- *Theme:* Volatile, transformative, risky

### Orichalcum (Ancient Metal)
**"The Unyielding"**
- Near-indestructible
- Fixed base properties
- Resists change - slow growth
- Maximum physical potential
- *Theme:* Eternal, unbreakable, warrior's pride

## Growing Weapons System

Rather than traditional crafting, weapons evolve through use:

### Growth Through Combat
- Kills against specific enemies influence development
- Many dragons = develops dragon-slaying traits
- Underground use = develops properties for darkness
- Water combat = develops rust resistance/water affinity

### Memory System
- Weapon remembers significant battles
- "Slayer of the Ancient Drake"
- "Survived the Depths"
- These memories provide subtle bonuses
- Players create stories naturally through use

### Development Paths

#### Specialized
- Focus on one type of combat
- Deep, specific bonuses
- Excellent in its niche

#### Adaptive
- Exposed to many situations
- Broader, flexible bonuses
- Jack of all trades

#### Volatile
- High risk/reward
- Unpredictable growth
- Potentially amazing results

### Example: Dagger Development

#### Assassin Focus
- High Silence + Precision = Shadow Strike
- Low Density + High Balance = Quick Strikes
- High Grain = Bleeding potential

#### Shadow Mage Focus
- High Resonance + Silence = Void Magic
- Stability + Attunement = Controlled Chaos
- Luminance (dark) = Shadow Power

## The Special Relationship

The special relationship comes from:
1. Shared history ("This sword helped me beat the first boss")
2. Investment of time
3. Unique development path
4. Personal involvement in growth
5. Memorable moments ("It proc'd perfectly in that clutch fight")

## System Benefits

This creates:
1. Clear choices
2. Natural specialization
3. Interesting tradeoffs
4. Build definition
5. Material hunting goals
6. Crafting depth

Rather than pure RNG crafting, the randomness comes from:
- Opportunities encountered
- Battles fought
- Situations survived
- Critical moments where weapon "learns"

This creates weapons that feel personal without being completely random or requiring complex crafting systems.
