# Game Naming Analysis & Recommendations

**Date:** 2025-11-17
**Issue:** Name collision with existing "Veinborn" roguelike
**Goal:** Find a name that better reflects our game's unique identity

---

## ✅ DECISION: Veinborn

**Official Name:** Veinborn
**Domain:** veinborn.gg ($80/yr)
**PyPI Package:** `pip install veinborn`
**Status:** VERIFIED CLEAR - No collisions found!

### The Name's Meaning

**Multiple layers of wordplay:**

1. **Ore Veins** → The core mining mechanic (hunt perfect ore vein spawns)
2. **Born Again** → Legacy Vault meta-progression (reborn between runs)
3. **"Veins of ore in your veins"** → When you die, purity 80+ ore goes to your Legacy Vault. On your next run, you're literally born with ore in your veins. You ARE the ore you mined.

**Tagline Options:**
- *"You are born with veins of ore in your veins"*
- *"Hunt perfect veins, be reborn legendary"*
- *"From the veins, to your veins"*
- *"Die with ore, live as ore"*

### Why Veinborn Works

- ✅ **Unique mechanic** → Ore vein system is our hook
- ✅ **Legacy Vault** → "Born again" with inherited ore
- ✅ **Epic feel** → "-born" suffix (Bloodborne precedent)
- ✅ **Multiplayer** → "We're all veinborn" (community identity)
- ✅ **Simple & memorable** → One word, easy to spell/pronounce
- ✅ **Available** → PyPI, GitHub, domains all clear

## The Problem: Veinborn Already Exists

### About the Original Veinborn (2009)

**Creator:** Brian Walker
**Status:** Active (maintained as "Veinborn: Community Edition")
**Famous For:**
- Direct descendant of Rogue (the 1980 game)
- Elegant, minimalist design philosophy
- "Simplicity over complexity" approach
- Very well-known in roguelike community
- Open source, widely played

**The Origin Story:**
Brian Walker was porting Rogue to Mac OS when his laptop was stolen. He started over from scratch, creating "Brian's Rogue" → Veinborn. It's a total rewrite with no code from original Rogue.

**Why This Matters:**
- Established brand in roguelike community (15+ years)
- Active player base and development
- Strong SEO presence, Wikipedia page, active wiki
- Using "Veinborn" will cause confusion for both communities
- PyPI package name collision inevitable

## What Makes Our Game Different

### Core Identity

Our game is **NOT** a minimalist, simplified roguelike. It's:

```
NetHack (complex systems)
  + SWG Mining (resource hunting dopamine)
  + Multiplayer Co-op (social play)
  + Legacy Progression (meta-game)
```

### Unique Selling Points

1. **Multiplayer-First Design**
   - "4 actions per round, anyone can take them"
   - Real-time coordination via WebSocket
   - Class synergies (Warrior/Mage/Healer/Rogue)
   - In-game chat and spectator mode

2. **SWG-Style Mining/Crafting**
   - Ore veins with 5 random properties (Hardness, Conductivity, Malleability, Purity, Density)
   - Resource hunting mini-game ("perfect spawn" dopamine hits)
   - Properties determine crafted item stats
   - Risk/reward (mining takes 3-5 turns, vulnerable)

3. **Legacy Vault Meta-Progression**
   - Purity 80+ ore saved across runs
   - Pure Victory vs Legacy Victory paths
   - Persistent progression in permadeath roguelike

4. **Group High-End Crafting**
   - Personal loot from shared veins
   - Trading between players
   - Community coordination for perfect gear
   - Guild vaults (planned)

### What We're NOT
- We're NOT minimalist (we embrace complexity)
- We're NOT single-player focused (multiplayer is core)
- We're NOT "Brian's Rogue" derivative

---

## Naming Criteria

A good name should:

1. **Reflect multiplayer/co-op** → Social play is core
2. **Suggest mining/crafting** → Resource hunting is unique
3. **Sound roguelike-ish** → Genre recognition
4. **Be memorable** → Easy to say, type, remember
5. **Avoid collisions** → Check existing games, PyPI packages
6. **Have available domains** → .com/.gg/.io for future

## Name Options

### Tier 1: Top Recommendations

#### 1. **Delve**
**Meaning:** To dig deep, to investigate thoroughly

**Why It Works:**
- ✅ Suggests mining (delving for ore)
- ✅ Suggests dungeon exploration (delving deeper)
- ✅ Simple, memorable, one syllable

- ✅ Multiplayer connotation ("let's delve together")
- ⚠️ Check: Some existing games use "delve" in title

**Variations:**
- `Delve & Forge` (emphasizes crafting)
- `Delvers` (emphasizes co-op group)
- `Deep Delve` (emphasizes depth progression)

**Package Name:** `pip install delve` or `pip install delvers`

---

#### 2. **Veinborne**
**Meaning:** Born from the veins (ore veins)

**Meaning:** Runners of the mine shafts

**Why It Works:**
- ✅ Suggests mining (shafts)

- ✅ "Runner" common in gaming (Shadowrun, Bladerunner)
- ⚠️ Plural vs singular decision

**Package Name:** `pip install shaftrunners`

**Package Name:** `pip install deephammer`

---

### Tier 3: Creative/Ambitious

**Why It Works:**

**Why It Works:**
- ✅ Multiplayer connotation (group expedition)
- ✅ Suggests resource hunting

- ❌ Less specific to game mechanics

---

### Tier 4: Play on "Veinborn" Etymology

If you want to keep the "bro" vibe:

#### 13. **Brigade**

**Why It Works:**
- ✅ Keeps "bro" sound (Br-)
- ✅ Emphasizes group play (brigade of adventurers)

**TL;DR:** You need to rename. "Veinborn" is taken by a famous 2009 roguelike. I recommend **Veinborne** (unique, emphasizes ore vein system, epic feel) or **Delvers** (simple, multiplayer, covers mining + dungeon diving).
