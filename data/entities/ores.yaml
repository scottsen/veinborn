# Ore Entity Definitions
#
# This file defines what ore types ARE (properties, quality ranges, tiers).
# Separate from ore_veins.yaml which defines WHERE/WHEN they spawn.
#
# Design Goals:
# - SWG-style resource hunting (random quality properties)
# - Data-driven ore generation (no hardcoded ranges)
# - Easy balancing (tweak quality ranges without code changes)
# - Support future crafting system

# Schema version (for future migrations)
schema_version: 1.0

# Modding support
# To add a new ore type:
# 1. Copy an existing ore definition
# 2. Change the ID (e.g., "silver")
# 3. Adjust tier, quality ranges, floor availability
# 4. Add to spawn_weights in ore_veins.yaml
# 5. Restart game - no code changes needed!
