# Monster Entity Definitions
#
# This file defines what monsters ARE (stats, behavior, appearance).
# Separate from monster_spawns.yaml which defines WHERE/WHEN they spawn.
#
# Design Goals:
# - Data-driven entity creation (no hardcoded factory methods)
# - Easy modding (add new monsters by editing YAML)
# - Designer-friendly (no code changes needed)
# - Support future features (loot tables, abilities, resistances)

# Schema version (for future migrations)
schema_version: 1.0
