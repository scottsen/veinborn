# Monster Spawning Configuration
#
# This file defines how monsters spawn on each floor, including:
# - Monster counts (how many spawn per floor)
# - Monster types and weights (spawn probabilities)
# - Difficulty progression over floors
#
# Design Goals:
# - Floor 1: Tutorial (only Goblins, beatable by new players)
# - Floors 2-5: Gradual difficulty increase
# - Floors 6-10: Balanced mix
# - Floors 11+: High difficulty (more Trolls)

# Monster count formulas by floor range
monster_counts:
  # Floors 1-6: Gentle introduction
  floors_1_6:
    base: 3
    divisor: 2
    formula: "3 + (floor // 2)"
    description: "Floor 1 = 3 monsters, Floor 2 = 4, etc."

  # Floors 7-20: Medium difficulty
  floors_7_20:
    base: 5
    divisor: 3
    formula: "5 + (floor // 3)"
    description: "Progressive scaling, 7-11 monsters"

  # Floors 21+: High difficulty (capped)
  floors_21_plus:
    base: 8
    divisor: 10
    formula: "min(12, 8 + (floor // 10))"
    max: 12
    description: "Caps at 12 monsters per floor"

# Monster spawn weights by floor
# Weight determines spawn probability
# Example: goblin: 70, orc: 30 = 70% Goblins, 30% Orcs
