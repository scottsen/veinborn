# Ore Vein Spawning Configuration
#
# This file defines ore vein generation:
# - How many ore veins spawn per floor
# - Which ore types appear at which depths
# - Quality ranges for each ore tier
#
# Design: SWG-style resource hunting
# - Deeper floors = better ore types
# - Random quality properties (hardness, conductivity, etc.)
# - Jackpot spawns (rare, high-quality ore)

# Ore vein counts per floor
ore_vein_counts:
  base: 8
  formula: "8 + (floor - 1)"
  description: "More ore veins on deeper floors"
  # Floor 1 = 8 veins, Floor 2 = 9 veins, Floor 10 = 17 veins, etc.

# Ore type distribution by floor depth
# Higher floors have better ore types
ore_types:
  copper:
    floors: [1, 2, 3]
    quality_range: [20, 50]
    description: "Early-game ore, low quality"

  iron:
    floors: [4, 5, 6]
    quality_range: [40, 70]
    description: "Mid-game ore, medium quality"

  mithril:
    floors: [7, 8, 9, 10]
    quality_range: [60, 90]
    description: "Late-game ore, high quality"

  adamantite:
    floors: [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
    quality_range: [80, 100]
    description: "End-game ore, exceptional quality"

# Ore spawn weights by floor tier
spawn_weights:
  floors_1_3:
    copper: 75
    iron: 25
    description: "Mostly copper, some iron"

  floors_4_6:
    copper: 0
    iron: 75
    mithril: 25
    description: "Mostly iron, some mithril"

  floors_7_plus:
    iron: 0
    mithril: 65
    adamantite: 35

# Ore properties (0-100 scale)
# Each ore vein gets random values for these properties
properties:
  hardness:
    description: "Affects weapon damage / armor defense"
    use: "Warriors want high hardness for melee damage"

  conductivity:
    description: "Affects magic power / spell efficiency"
    use: "Mages want high conductivity for spell power"

  malleability:
    description: "Affects durability / repair ease"
    use: "General quality of life stat"

  purity:
    description: "Quality multiplier (affects all stats)"
    use: "High purity = better overall item"
    special: "80+ purity ore saved to Legacy Vault on death"

  density:
    description: "Affects weight / encumbrance"
    use: "Low density = lighter equipment"

# Mining mechanics
mining:
  turns_required:
    min: 3
    max: 5
    description: "Mining takes 3-5 turns, you're vulnerable!"

  risk_reward:
    description: "Mine now (dangerous) or come back safer?"
    design_goal: "Create meaningful decisions"

# Jackpot spawns (rare, exceptional ore)
jackpot_spawns:
  chance: 0.05  # 5% chance per ore vein
  quality_boost: 20  # +20 to all properties
  tier_boost: 2  # Spawn ore 2 tiers higher
  description: "OMG PERFECT SPAWN moments"
  example: "Find Mithril on Floor 3 with 95+ hardness"

# Legacy Vault (meta-progression)
legacy_vault:
  purity_threshold: 80
  description: "Ore with 80+ purity survives death"
  victory_types:
    pure: "Start with nothing - maximum street cred"
    legacy: "Start with Legacy ore - easier but less prestigious"
