# Forge Spawning Configuration
#
# Forges are crafting stations where players turn ore → equipment
# This is the KEY interaction point for Veinborn's unique hook
#
# Design Goals:
# - Forges are rare but consistent (1-2 per floor)
# - Better forges on deeper floors
# - Forges are fixed (not destroyable/mineable)

# Forge counts per floor
forge_counts:
  base: 1
  formula: "1"  # Always 1 forge per floor (consistency > variance)
  description: "One forge per floor, guaranteed crafting access"

# Forge type distribution by floor depth
