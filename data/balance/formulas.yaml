# Game Formula Configuration
#
# Centralizes all mathematical formulas used in game mechanics.
# Makes it easy to tune combat balance, progression curves, etc.

# Combat Formulas
combat:
  # Damage Calculation
  damage:
    formula: "max(1, attacker_attack - defender_defense)"
    description: "Base damage formula, minimum 1 damage"
    min_damage: 1
    max_damage: 9999

  # Critical Hit
  critical_hit:
    chance: 0.1  # 10% chance
    multiplier: 2.0  # Double damage

  # Accuracy (future)
  accuracy:
    base_chance: 0.9  # 90% hit chance
    formula: "0.9"  # Can add attacker_dex / defender_dex later

# Health & Regeneration
health:
  # HP Regeneration
  regen_per_turn: 0  # Currently no passive regen
  regen_out_of_combat: 1  # Regen 1 HP/turn when not in combat (10+ turns)

  # Healing Items (future)
  potion_heal_percent: 0.5  # Heal 50% of max HP

# Mining Formulas
mining:
  # Mining Time Calculation
  base_turns: 3
  min_turns: 3
  max_turns: 5
  formula: "min_turns + (hardness * (max_turns - min_turns) // 100)"
  description: "Mining turns based on ore hardness (0-100)"

  # Mining Success Rate (currently 100%)
  success_rate: 1.0

# Crafting Formulas
crafting:
  # Crafting Time
  base_turns: 1  # Instant crafting currently

  # Item Stat Calculation
  weapon_attack:
    formula: "base_attack * (1 + purity/100) * tier_multiplier"
    description: "Attack = base × purity bonus × tier"

  armor_defense:
    formula: "base_defense * (1 + purity/100) * tier_multiplier"
    description: "Defense = base × purity bonus × tier"

  # Tier Multipliers
  tier_multipliers:
    copper: 1.0
    iron: 1.3
    steel: 1.6
    adamantite: 2.0

# Experience & Progression (future)
progression:
  xp_per_monster_level: 10
  xp_formula: "monster_level * 10"
  level_up_threshold: 100
