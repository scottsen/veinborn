# Spawning Configuration
#
# This file centralizes all spawning-related parameters that were previously
# hardcoded in the game logic. It covers:
# - Special room entity counts and bonuses
# - Ore vein positioning rules
# - Special room assignment probabilities
#
# Design Goals:
# - Make monster density easily tunable
# - Allow designers to adjust special room rewards without touching code
# - Centralize magic numbers for better game balance iteration

# Special Room Entity Spawning
# These rooms provide bonus rewards and challenges beyond standard spawning
special_rooms:
  # Treasure Room - High-quality ore rewards
  treasure_room:
    ore_count:
      min: 2
      max: 3
      description: "Number of ore veins to spawn in treasure rooms"

    ore_purity:
      min: 80
      max: 95
      description: "Purity range for treasure room ores (higher = better quality)"

    description: "Treasure rooms contain 2-3 high-purity ore veins"

  # Monster Den - Extra dangerous encounters
  monster_den:
    monster_count:
      min: 2
      max: 4
      description: "Number of extra monsters to spawn in monster dens"

    stat_boost_multiplier: 1.2
    description: "Monster dens spawn 2-4 extra monsters with +20% boosted stats"

  # Ore Chamber - Rich mining location
  ore_chamber:
    ore_count:
      min: 3
      max: 5
      description: "Number of ore veins to spawn in ore chambers"

    ore_purity:
      min: 70
      max: 85
      description: "Purity range for ore chamber ores"

    description: "Ore chambers contain 3-5 good-quality ore veins"

# Ore Vein Positioning Rules
ore_positioning:
  wall_adjacency_probability: 0.1
  description: "10% chance for wall-adjacent floor tiles to become ore spawn positions"
  explanation: "Ore veins spawn adjacent to walls for a 'embedded in rock' feel"

# Special Room Assignment Configuration
special_room_assignment:
  # Percentage of eligible rooms that become special
  percentage:
    min: 0.2  # 20% minimum
    max: 0.3  # 30% maximum
    description: "20-30% of rooms (excluding start/stairs rooms) become special"

  # Room type weights - higher weight = more common
  # Total weight: 9
  room_type_weights:
    treasure_room: 2
    monster_den: 2
    ore_chamber: 3  # Most common - fits game's mining theme
    shrine: 1       # Rare healing/buff locations
    trap_room: 1    # Rare hazardous locations

# Monster Density Configuration
# This section provides easy tuning knobs for adjusting overall game difficulty
monster_density:
  description: "These multipliers affect monster counts globally"

  # Global multiplier for all monster spawns
  global_multiplier: 1.0
  explanation: "Set to 1.5 for 50% more monsters, 0.75 for 25% fewer"

  # Per-tier multipliers (override global for specific floor ranges)
  tier_multipliers:
    early_game:  # Floors 1-6
      multiplier: 1.0
      description: "Early floors use standard spawn rates"

    mid_game:    # Floors 7-20
      multiplier: 1.0
      description: "Mid floors use standard spawn rates"

    late_game:   # Floors 21+
      multiplier: 1.0
